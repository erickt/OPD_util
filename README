Basic utilities for reading crime data from:
- Oakland Police Department
- Alameda County Sheriff
- Urban Strategies Council

A variable `DataDir` should be set to the location of these files.
All are added to a single sqlite database, and this is written
to the same directory as `crime.db`.

Two basic routines showing how this data can be accessed are also included:
- `analOPD_dateDist(dbfile)` produces a simple distribution of crimes by year
- `dbg_OPD_USC(dbfile)` is being used to compare/contrast these two data sources
